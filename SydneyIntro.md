# Hi I am Sydney! She/Her

## Who
My name is Sydney Meyer - Sydney Pronounced like Australia and Meyer pronounced like the grocery store Meijer. 

I am currently pursuing a combined Bachelors and Masters degree in Applied Statistics at Grand Valley. 

## Ideal Occupation
My ideal occupation is that one day my dream career would be to be a professor. I really enjoy learning and teaching people and would love to teach
statistics one day. I have already started trying to build me resume for this by being involved with Grand Valley's Statistics program.
I have been a facilitator for STA 215 this past semester under Professor Daniels. It was an awesome experience! In the fall my schedule is a lot busier so
I will not have the time to facilitate again, but I do plan on working in the tutoring center!

## Why I am in this course
I am in this course because it is required for the Masters in Applied Statistics, but I am also very interested in learning R. Many of my Stats professors
here at Grand Valley ove R (especially Dr. Gabrosek). I think knowing R will be very valuable for me to know as I hope to be a professor one day, 
but also while I am working in the Statistics field!

## Other
I am not following anyone on social media that is doing what I want to do currently, but I do look up to most of the professors I have had at Grand Valley.
They have all been so nice and supportive to me and set an excellent example for what I want to be one day!

## Some interesting things about me
To start off some interestings things about me is that my family owns a Dairy Queen so I have been working there for the past 7 years. I love it and it is
such a fun enviornment to work in, but since most of my life is now on the west side of Michigan I have stopped working there full time.
I currently work at a bar downtown named O'Tooles! We are an Irish pub on bridge street. It is a great place to work and a super fun enviornment!

Some other facts about me is that I LOVE to skydive I have gone multiple times and plan on going again in the next few weeks!
